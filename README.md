## Introduction

- This project explores the relationship between various movie attributes and their outcomes in terms of revenue, popularity, and user ratings. By leveraging a comprehensive movie dataset, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can inform future movie production and marketing strategies.

## Problem Statement

- How can various factors affect the success and the review of movies ?
